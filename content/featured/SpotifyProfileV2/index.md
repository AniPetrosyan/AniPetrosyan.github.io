I was an assistant at the Robotics Workshop in Tumo in 2019. There was one more assistant with me. The students were using lots of different legos to make their robots. But after every class, it was needed to put those legos back in a sorted way for the next session's students. And the workshop leader was always giving us the task to sort the different parts of the lego robots. It was a very boring task and my friend and I decided to make a robot as a solution for this.

Our robot sorts different legos and puts them in different places. 
Firstly, we made a 3D model for all the lego types. After that, we printed it with our 3D printer. You can see it under the green thing. Then we made our robot with different legos.
We made the green thing with the 3D printer as well. In the green thing, we put different legos which are not sorted and the robot starts to move from left to right. As a result, every lego starts to fall from its place down to the red box.
