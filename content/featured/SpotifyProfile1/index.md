The lab of MIT alumna Lara Shonkwiller was about generating sound and music in Python. We primarily used Numpy library. The creative part of this lab was creating music. We created Python program that took the medipitch notation and turned it into an actual sound. Music processing isn't talked about much in school often but I discovered that there is really very interesting math and science that goes into it. Lara taught us Signal Processing, we did different assignments which you can see in the Github link. However, I was the only student at the lab who completed the exercise 8th. You can see the result of exercise 8's in the video.
