This is a project from Princeton alumnus Narek Galstyan's lab. Our team was working on creating something like a little photoshop. There are several filters in this, let's say little photoshop, and every student was assigned to implement one. My part was the Image Morphing part. In the video, you can see my work's result in the end, which is like a gif that shows Trump's one image into another through a seamless transition. I used JavaScript to implement this project.
