I used the skills I have learned in the learning lab of Shahbaz Mogal from Microsoft to create and train deep learning models from scratch on a classification task. The final work was sarcasm detectionÂ· I used neural networks used in AI, concepts like loss, back-propagation, Pytorch, standard NLP workflow (tokenization, POS tagging, etc.) and tested the model.
The model can detect sarcasm in any language. My mentor Shahbaz helped me to find the dataset.
In the video, I test the model in Armenian because there are only a few models which understand Armenian. 
Here is what I wrote in Armenian: 
1. The teacher learns more from his student than the student learns from the teacher: 93.26% sarcastic and 6.74% not sarcastic.
2. I love my mother - 2.08% sarcastic and 97.92% not sarcastic.
Before pushing my code to Github I wrote: "Ani is the best programmer" - 31.29% sarcastic, 68.71% not sarcastic :)
